In Java, annotations are a form of metadata that can be added to Java source code. 
Annotations provide additional information about the code to compilers, tools, and 
run-time environments. They do not directly affect the program's logic but can 
influence the way the program is treated by tools or libraries.

Annotations are introduced using the @ symbol followed by the annotation name. 
They can be applied to various program elements, including classes, methods, fields, 
parameters, and more.

Built-in Annotations:
Java provides several built-in annotations, such as @Override, @Deprecated, and 
@SuppressWarnings. These annotations help the compiler and tools to catch potential 
issues, provide documentation, or suppress warnings.
