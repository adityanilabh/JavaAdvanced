1. In this problem, we have two method to search an elemnt in the array.
   The first one is: Binary Search and Second one is Linear Search

2. Our logic here is to give annotation to the binary search for optimisation of 
   searching element in the array.

Documentation for class design:
1. SearchMethods.java: this java file contains main method and entry point of our application
    - The class with have main function, will contains functions like userinput,check 
      execution time for each search and output elements.
2. ArrayMethodsInterface.java: this file will contains interface and all the method declaration
    - like input from user, output, binary search and linear search

3. ArrayMethod.java : this java class will implements ArrayMethodsInterface and will have logic
   override methods of it's interface, it contains USER DEFINED ANNOTATION.
