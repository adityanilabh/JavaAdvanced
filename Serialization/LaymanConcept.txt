Jesse PinkMan: 
Yo, Mr. White! So, like, you know when we gotta stash our precious info, 
like a top-secret recipe or something? What if we could turn that info into a 
magical mini version, like, put it in a little box, and then easily send it across 
town or stash it in our hideout? Can we do that, Mr. White? Is there some kind of 
wizardry to make This Thing happen in Java Yo!?

walter white: 
Jesse, i knew you are an idiot but somehow i was not expecting this question from you.
This is what happen when you don't attend my computer science class:
Here is a simple explanation for you Jesse: 
"
Serialization is like turning an object (a bunch of data and its behavior) 
into a form that can be easily saved, sent across the internet, or stored in a 
file. It's like putting your favorite toy into a box so you can give it to a 
friend or keep it safe for later.

Imagine you have a magic spell that can turn your toy into a small, 
compact version that you can easily share with others. That's what 
serialization does to objects in Java. It takes all the information about an 
object and turns it into a package (like a magical box) that can be easily moved 
around or saved for later.

Later, when you want to use your toy again, you can use another magic spell 
(deserialization) to turn it back into its original form, with all its details 
and features intact. This way, you can share objects between programs, save them 
to your computer, or send them to your friends over the internet.

jesse pinkman: 
Yo, Mr. White! You mean, like, you're telling me we can turn our super-secret 
code into some kind of tiny, transportable thing? Like, we can just zap it into 
this, like, travel-size version and then, bam, send it wherever we want? That's, 
like, some serious next-level stuff, man. Science, b*tch!

Walter White: 
Jesse , not Science, It's computer science;

Jesse: Same thing yo!
