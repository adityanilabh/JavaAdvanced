Problem Statement:
Create a program that simulates a ticket booking system for a cinema. 
The cinema has a limited number of seats, and multiple users are trying to book 
tickets simultaneously. Implement a multi-threaded application where each thread
 represents a user trying to book tickets. The program should ensure that two threads 
 do not book the same seat at the same time, and it should also handle cases where 
 all seats are booked.

Requirements:

The cinema has a total of 50 seats.
Each user (thread) should randomly select a seat to book.
If a seat is already booked by another user, the current user should try to 
book another seat.
Display a message for each successful booking, indicating the seat number and 
the user who booked it.
Ensure that the program terminates gracefully when all seats are booked.
