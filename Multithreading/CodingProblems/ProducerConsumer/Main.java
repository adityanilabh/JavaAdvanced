/*
 * You are tasked with implementing a program that simulates the interaction between producers and consumers using multiple threads. The producers generate items and add them to a shared buffer, while consumers retrieve and process items from the buffer. Your goal is to ensure proper synchronization to avoid race conditions and deadlocks.
 */

 /* step1: create a producer class
  * step 2: create a consumer class
    step 3: create a buffer class that will contains threads.
    step 4: conditions: 
              in buffer: 1. to store threads- data structure used: queue
              in consumer class: take the thread from buffer, and output it:
                                 wait if thread is empty in queue.
              in producer class: make new threads.
                                 wait if thread is full in queue.
