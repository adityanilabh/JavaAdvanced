Java exception keyword?

- try: The "try" keyword is used to specify a block where we should place an 
exception code. It means we can't use try block alone. The try block must be 
followed by either catch or finally.

-catch: the  "catch" block is used to handle the exception. It must be preceded 
by try block which means we can't use catch block alone. It can be followed by
 finally block later.

-finally: The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. 
It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.

-throw: The "finally" block is used to execute the necessary code of the program. 
It is executed whether an exception is handled or not.

-throws: The "throws" keyword is used to declare exceptions. It specifies 
that there may occur an exception in the method. It doesn't throw an exception. 
It is always used with method signature.

Important point: 
1. Unchecked exception can propagate through methods, but checked can't until 
and unless you declare it with throws( not to be confused with throw).
