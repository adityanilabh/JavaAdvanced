In Java, exceptions allows us to write good quality codes where the errors are 
checked at the compile time instead of runtime and we can create custom exceptions 
making the code recovery and debugging easier.

===============================================================================
We specify the exception object which is to be thrown. The Exception has some 
message with it that provides the error description. These exceptions may be 
related to user inputs, server, etc.

We can throw either checked or unchecked exceptions in Java by throw keyword. 
It is mainly used to throw a custom exception. We will discuss custom exceptions 
later in this section.
